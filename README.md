# AfterSolve

**AfterSolve** is a one-stop platform for competitive programmers to upsolve problems from contests they actually participated in, through a minimalistic, responsive interface.

The app fetches real-time data from the Codeforces API and presents it intuitively, making it easier to explore contests and problems without navigating the Codeforces website directly.
